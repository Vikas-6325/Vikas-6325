### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at **National Institute of Technology Manipur (NIT Manipur)**, with a strong focus on **Defensive Security**, **Vulnerability Management**, and **Machine Learning for Cybersecurity**. I am passionate about leveraging data to detect anomalies and securing enterprise infrastructure using industry-standard tools.
My passion lies in the intersection of AI and Cybersecurity. I don't just use tools; I build scripts to automate them. Whether it's training **Random Forest classifiers** to detect malicious URLs or deploying **Tenable Nessus** to secure a mixed-OS network, I focus on data-driven security solutions.

* 🎓 **Education:** B.Tech in Computer Science (Expected May 2027).
* ⚡ **Achivement:** Maintained a 150+ day streak on TryHackMe while juggling engineering exams!
* 📚 **Relevant Coursework:** Web Development, Computer Networks, Info Sec, Data Structures & Algorithms.
* 🔭 **Focus:** Vulnerability Management, SIEM, and Network Forensics.
* 🏆 **Achievement:** Global Top 9% Rank on TryHackMe(Tryhackme Badges).
